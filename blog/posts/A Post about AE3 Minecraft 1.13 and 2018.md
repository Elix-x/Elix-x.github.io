A Post about Applied Energistics 3, Minecraft 1.13 and 2018
===========================================================

As 2018 approaches, I think it is a good time to go over what was done in 2017
and look into the future, to see what it has to offer.

Especially considering that there’s hasn’t been a single commit since August, it
would be normal to consider AE3 dead. It is not. But let’s first go over 2017
first.

2017
----

### Repository split

Though a lot has happened prior, this is one of the most important events for
AE3 this year - [repository split in
May](https://github.com/AEModernMCPort/Applied-Energistics-3-ReOver/commit/d11be80038c615bfcca37341b3d232b060a40b2e).
Before that day, all work was done in the fork from Applied Energistics 2
repository, with old and new code side by side – it was impossible to test
anything we were creating what so ever. And so we created a new empty repo, then
populated it with core code that we have previously written in the forked repo
and made clear everywhere that there are 2 repos now. This allowed us to
actually fix newly implemented modules system and see stuff in game. This was a
huge deal. So huge, that everything done from this day, was done in the new
repo.

### Apogee of development *(of 2017)*

Almost 3 months.  
10 branches.  
Over 350 commits.

The list of what has been implemented is quite large– finalized bootstrapping,
fully working modules, [almost complete microparts
library](https://github.com/AEModernMCPort/Applied-Energistics-3-ReOver/issues/2),
base materials, beginning of ion reactions, generation and rendering of falling
meteorites…

### And then nothing…

…void … emptiness … silence… why?

First reason – I was quite busy, and apparently when I’m not able to dedicate
time to modding, nobody else in the team is. *This post is about AE3,* [the
reason(s) of my absence, per
say](https://twitter.com/Elix_x_mc/status/940698956425846784)*, will be
discussed in a dedicated one.*

Second reason – Mojang announced clearly what is going to change in 1.13, later
in the year followed by snapshots. The technical changes are significant, and
when you want to build a house, but know that before you have time to finish,
you will have to demolish it and restart, building the house right now looks
very inefficient, while also kind of depressing –you’ll have to stay homeless
for this entire time.

Considering that I had a lot of *stuff* to do, I could not really waste time is
almost useless in the long term. This does look like a jerk move, *if you know
me only from modding*.  
And **I am sorry** for not saying it till today, as much as I am for still not
telling all the reasons for it.

Minecraft 1.13 and 2018
-----------------------

As I said already, Minecraft 1.13 with all of its changes was officially
announced, unlimited block ids, removal of metadata, JSON recipes being the main
deal breakers. I am not going to go over them – there are a lot – and you have
MC website for snapshot changelogs.

So… now what?

Well, now we know that re-doing materials to not use metadata was a move in the
good direction. We also know that 1.13 update will be devastating in modding,
“worse” than 1.8 (of course, in the time required to update sense).  
So, **No modding until Forge 1.13 is released!**  
:upside_down_face: :gun:

*Unless, the spirit of 2018 with the magic of the New Year shows something
independent from Minecraft, yet most important part of Applied Energistics 3.*  
~~But I haven’t seen the spirit this year, so sorry :(.~~
